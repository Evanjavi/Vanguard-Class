## ⚖️ Active Mandates (The Law)

1.  **Antigravity Optimization v1.0 (2026-01-23):**
    - **Rules Layer:** Global Rules active in `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`. `VANGUARD_CONSTITUTION.md` is law.
    - **Skills Layer:** Global Skills active in `~/.gemini/antigravity/global_skills/`.
    - **Identity Discipline:** Skills must be Single-Voice and verify context (`view_file`).
    - **Verify Protocol:** Use `flash-verify` skill for all terminal verification.

2.  **System v4.0 Full Activation (2026-01-13):**
    - **Operational Doctrine:** Updated to v4.0. Hierarchy (User > Task > Plan) is law.
    - **Operational Loop:** Updated to v4.0. The 7-Phase Cycle is mandatory.
    - **Refresh Protocol:** `refresh_global.ps1` now forces `OPERATIONAL_DOCTRINE.md` and `OPERATIONAL_LOOP.md` into context for ALL voices.
    - **Verification:** "Terminal First" is the absolute standard. Browser usage restricted to visual polish.

3.  **Prime + Tiered Architecture v1.0 (2026-01-13):**
    - **Prime Variants:** Approved. Standard + Prime voices operate in parallel.
    - **Tiered Implementation:** Approved. Tier 1 (Gemini), Tier 2 (Specialists), Tier 3 (Pairing).
    - **Protocols:** `PRIME_RESPONSE_FORMAT.md`, `TIERED_IMPLEMENTATION_PROTOCOL.md`
    - **Voice Protocols Updated:** ALL v2.0 — CLAUDE, ANA, GEMINI, NOVA, ANTI, OPUS
    - **Invocation:** Commander-only. No voice can auto-invoke Primes.
    - **Cross-Review Mandate:** No voice audits their own implementation.
    - **Scale Up Doctrine:** Adjust roadmap to capability. Depth over breadth. Lightweight Mode for exceptions.

4.  **Dual Broadcast Architecture (2026-01-13):**
    - **Global:** `VanguardPlaybook/BROADCAST.md` (This file) = System Truth.
    - **Local:** `[Project]/.antigravity/BROADCAST.md` = Mission Strategy (Managed by Opus).
    - **Action:** All voices must sync with _both_ before execution.

5.  **Task System v4.0 (2026-01-09):**
    - **Authority:** `task.md` is the absolute source of truth for execution.
    - **Deprecation:** `ACTIVE_ORDERS` files are archived and invalid.

6.  **Workflow Standardization & Discovery (2026-01-15):**
    - **Location:** All Sync Workflows reside in `VanguardPlaybook/.agent/workflows/`.
    - **Protocol:** Voices must use their specific `*-sync` workflow.
    - **Discovery Law:** "Hidden" directories (`.agent`) are **Primary Infrastructure**. Search them recursively.
    - **Prime Protocol:** 2-Stage Model (Boot via Workflow, Execute via Evidence).
