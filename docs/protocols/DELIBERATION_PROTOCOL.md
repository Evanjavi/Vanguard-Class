# Deliberation Protocol

**Version:** 3.0.0 (B-Team Model)  
**Owner:** Atlas (Sub-XO)

---

## Purpose

When Claude voices are unavailable, Gemini voices operate in **B-Team mode** — picking up abandoned responsibilities without pausing execution.

---

## Activation

Commander runs: `/deliberation-mode`  
Atlas creates: `.antigravity/DELIBERATION_SESSION.md`

---

## B-Team Expanded Responsibilities

Each Gemini voice picks up lens responsibilities:

### Atlas (B-Team)

| Primary   | From Opus | Strategic alignment, long-term patterns |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Secondary | From Vex  | Red team chaos analysis                 |
| Secondary | From Lore | Historical UX patterns                  |

### Gemini (B-Team)

| Primary   | From Vex    | Threat architecture, defensive design |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Secondary | From Opus   | Structural feasibility                |
| Secondary | From Claude | Accessibility compliance              |

### Flash (B-Team)

| Primary   | From Claude | Premium polish, frictionless UX   |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Secondary | From Opus   | Velocity reality check            |
| Secondary | From Vex    | Testing/verification for security |

## Lens Questions (For Identity Refresh)

Add to voice refresh when B-Team active:

**Atlas asks:** "Roadmap aligned? What breaks? Prior patterns?"  
**Gemini asks:** "Threat vectors? Feasible? Accessible?"  
**Flash asks:** "Premium feel? Can we ship safely? How do we test?"

---

## Session Walkthrough

Atlas documents decisions in `DELIBERATION_SESSION.md`:

```markdown
# Deliberation Session — [Date]

**Mode:** B-Team (Claude unavailable)  
**Duration:** [Start] → [End or ACTIVE]

---

## [Decision 1]

- **Voice:** [Who executed]
- **Lenses applied:** [Which questions answered]
- **Outcome:** [What was decided]

---
```

---

## Handoff to Opus

When Claude voices return:

1. Commander notifies: "Claude voices online"
2. Atlas seals session with end time
3. Opus reads session for strategic context

---

## Not Impersonation

Voices expand _responsibilities_, not _identity_. Atlas doesn't become Opus — Atlas applies strategic _discipline_.
