# Pattern: Voice Specialization

**Category:** collaboration

---

## Context
When multiple AI assistants (or team members) work on a project, overlapping responsibilities cause confusion and inconsistent decisions.

## Solution
Assign clear domains to each voice:
- **Opus**  Strategy, architecture, planning
- **Gemini**  Execution, implementation, context
- **Claude**  Documentation, testing, refinement
- **Ana**  Security, verification, audit

## Benefits
- Clear ownership reduces conflicts
- Handoffs have defined scope
- Each voice operates at full depth in their domain

## Example
FlorSys v0.99x: Opus designed Chorus v2 protocol, Gemini implemented it, Claude would document it, Ana would audit.
