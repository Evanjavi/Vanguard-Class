# Pattern: Industry Reference Protocol

**Category:** discovery

---

## Context
During project intake, clients often struggle to articulate exactly what they want. Abstract descriptions lead to misaligned expectations.

## Solution
Always provide 2-3 industry references (existing products) that relate to the project vision:
1. Research similar tools during or after intake
2. Present references with specific relevant features noted
3. Ask: "Is this close to what you're imagining?"

## Benefits
- Grounds abstract ideas in concrete examples
- Client can point to specific features they like/dislike
- Reduces miscommunication risk

## Example
FlorSys intake: Referenced Tripcase (logistics), Wanderlog (collaboration), Proposify (client review loop). Client responded: "I love seeing this."
