# Pattern: Industry Reference in Reviews

**Category:** discovery

---

## Context
During Chorus Reviews, voices can get stuck in familiar patterns. Fresh perspective is needed.

## Solution
Include industry references in every briefing document:
1. List 2-4 comparable products
2. Highlight specific features relevant to review
3. Add mandatory "Out-of-the-Box Idea" question

Each voice must propose ONE creative idea inspired by references.

## Benefits
- Grounds abstract discussions in concrete examples
- Sparks creative thinking
- Prevents "reinventing the wheel"

## Example
Ceviche Bar briefings included: Paprika (scaling), Notion (relations), Mealie (self-hosted), ChefTap (import).
