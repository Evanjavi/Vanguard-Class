# Pattern: WBS-Driven Development

**Category:** workflow

---

## Context
Projects accumulate ad-hoc tasks. Without a single source of truth, priorities drift.

## Solution
Maintain a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) as the master plan:
- Every feature maps to a WBS item
- Status tracked in one place
- Version scope is explicit

## Benefits
- No hidden scope
- Easy handoff (""read the WBS"")
- Progress is visible

## Example
FlorSys `WBS.md` tracked every version's features. Nothing shipped without WBS entry.
