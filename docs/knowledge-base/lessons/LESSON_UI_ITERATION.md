## Situation
Initial UI was functional but lacked visual appeal. User wanted ""glassy"" aesthetic with depth.

## Action
Iterative refinement:
1. Added backdrop-blur and transparent backgrounds
2. Introduced white shine gradients on dark surfaces
3. Standardized color palette (removed generic colors)
4. Applied consistent spacing and micro-animations

## Result
UI went from ""functional but plain"" to ""premium modern."" Commander satisfaction high.

## Lesson
**UI polish is iterative, not one-shot.** Budget time for 2-3 refinement passes after functional completion.
