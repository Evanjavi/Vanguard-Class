## Situation
When switching voices mid-project, critical decisions were lost. New voice had to rediscover context.

## Action
Introduced mandatory handoff notes:
- What was done
- What decisions were made (and why)
- What's next
- Open questions

## Result
Voice transitions became smooth. No more repeated questions. Decision history preserved.

## Lesson
**Never end a session without a handoff artifact.** Even if you expect to continue yourself, write one.
