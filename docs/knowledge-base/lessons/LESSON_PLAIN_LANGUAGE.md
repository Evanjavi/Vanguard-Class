## Situation
Created a Project Intake Questionnaire with standard software terminology ("entities", "actions", "relations"). Tested with a real user (Flor).

## Action
Flor flagged Section 3 as confusing: "I dont understand this question."

## Result
Rewrote questionnaire in plain language:
- "entities"  "things you create or manage"
- "actions"  "what will you DO most often"
- Added checkboxes for common actions

## Lesson
**Never use jargon in user-facing documents.** If a non-technical person has to ask "what does this mean?", the document has failed. Test questionnaires with real users before finalizing.
