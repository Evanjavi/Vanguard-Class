## Situation
Versions were declared ""done"" without consistent verification. Sometimes builds were broken, docs outdated.

## Action
Established mandatory version end checklist:
1. Run build verification (`/verify-build`)
2. Update WBS with completed items
3. Create backup/capsule
4. Write handoff note
5. Update THE_BOOK

## Result
Every version closes cleanly. No loose ends. Next session starts from solid ground.

## Lesson
**Never bump a version without running the protocol.** Shortcuts create debt.
