# Lesson: Semantic Versioning Discipline

**Date:** 2026-01-02  
**Project:** FlorSys  
**Category:** workflow

## Situation
Early versions were arbitrary. ""v0.12"" meant nothing. Progress felt random.

## Action
Adopted strict semantic versioning:
- **Major (v1.0)**  stable, feature-complete milestone
- **Minor (v0.x)**  new feature or significant change
- **Patch (v0.x.y)**  bug fix or small tweak

v0.x explicitly means ""experimental."" v1.0 signals readiness.

## Result
Version numbers tell a story. Team knows what stage the project is in.

## Lesson
**Version numbers are communication, not counters.** Choose them deliberately.
