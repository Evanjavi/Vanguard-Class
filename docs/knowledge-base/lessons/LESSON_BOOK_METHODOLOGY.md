# Lesson: The Book Methodology

**Date:** 2026-01-02  
**Project:** FlorSys  
**Category:** context

---

## Situation
Project history was scattered across multiple notes, handoffs, and conversation memories. Continuity suffered.

## Action
Created `THE_BOOK_OF_FLORSYS.md` as the single historical record:
- Chronological entries by version
- Key decisions and rationale
- Major milestones and pivots

## Result
Any voice can read THE_BOOK and understand project evolution. No more archaeology.

## Lesson
**Every project gets a Book.** One file. Append-only. Contains the full narrative from day one.
