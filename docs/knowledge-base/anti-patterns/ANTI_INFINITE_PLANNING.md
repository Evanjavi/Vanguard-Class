# Anti-Pattern: Infinite Planning

**Category:** workflow

---

## Symptom
Planning sessions extend indefinitely. Documents grow but nothing ships.

## Cause
Fear of missing edge cases, or comfort in planning vs. execution.

## Solution
- Time-box planning (e.g., 30 min max for small features)
- Define ""good enough"" criteria upfront
- Ship, then iterate

## Real Example
FlorSys early versions had excessive planning artifacts. v0.99+ shifted to rapid execution with minimal viable plans.
