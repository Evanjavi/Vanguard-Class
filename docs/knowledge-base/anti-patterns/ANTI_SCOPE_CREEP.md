**Category:** workflow

---

## Symptom
Simple tasks balloon. ""While we're at it..."" cascades into major rework.

## Cause
- No explicit scope boundaries
- Desire to ""fix everything""
- Poor task estimation

## Solution
- Define scope upfront (what IS and ISN'T included)
- Log ""nice to haves"" for later versions
- Ask: ""Is this required for the stated goal?""

## Real Example
FlorSys UX debt sessions were scoped to specific issues  adjacent improvements logged for v1.0.
