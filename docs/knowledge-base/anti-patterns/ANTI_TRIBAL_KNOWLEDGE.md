# Anti-Pattern: Tribal Knowledge

**Category:** collaboration

---

## Symptom
Key information exists only in one person's (or one voice's) memory. New participants can't onboard.

## Cause
- ""I'll remember this""
- Time pressure skips documentation
- Assumption of continuity

## Solution
- Capture decisions in artifacts immediately
- Maintain THE_BOOK (project history)
- Use handoff notes religiously

## Real Example
Early FlorSys sessions lost context between voices. Solved by introducing HANDOFF_NOTE.md and THE_BOOK_OF_FLORSYS.md.
