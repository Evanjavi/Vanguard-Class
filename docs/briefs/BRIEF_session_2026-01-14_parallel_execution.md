# Strategic Session Brief — Parallel Execution Protocol

**To:** Atlas (Next Session)  
**From:** Opus  
**Date:** 2026-01-14  
**Re:** Workflow adaptation to Antigravity platform constraints

---

## Executive Summary

Antigravity's model selector is globally scoped. When switching models, all conversation windows switch together. This session established the **Same-Agent Parallelism Protocol** and finalized Chorus nomenclature.

## Nomenclature (Final)

| Name   | Signature | Voice of... | Prime Name    | Model Agent                |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| Opus   | 🎯        | Strategy    | The Oracle    | Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking   |
| Claude | 🎭        | Beauty      | The Lens      | Claude Sonnet 4.5          |
| Vex    | 🛡️        | Safety      | The Hunter    | Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking |
| Gemini | 💎        | Structure   | The Forge     | Gemini 3 Pro Low           |
| Atlas  | 📚        | Archive     | The Invariant | Gemini 3 Pro High          |
| Flash  | ⚡        | Velocity    | The Tempest   | Gemini 3 Pro Flash         |

**Signature Usage:** Start responses with signature emoji for instant voice identification.

## Same-Agent Parallelism Rule

**Rule:** Voices sharing a model agent may run in parallel.

| Name   | Can Parallel With                              |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Opus   | Opus Standard × N, The Oracle × N, any mix     |
| Claude | Claude Standard × N, The Lens × N, any mix     |
| Vex    | Vex Standard × N, The Hunter × N, any mix      |
| Gemini | Gemini Standard × N, The Forge × N, any mix    |
| Atlas  | Atlas Standard × N, The Invariant × N, any mix |
| Flash  | Flash Standard × N, The Tempest × N, any mix   |

**Cross-agent = sequential switch required.**

## Delegation Tasks

### Batch 1: Documentation

1. **Add Same-Agent Parallelism Rule** — Update `OPERATIONAL_LOOP.md` with rule 4
2. **Verify Nomenclature** — Ensure all non-historical docs use new names, "Voice of X" pattern, and Prime names
3. **Update WBS.md** — Currently shows v0.4.0, needs update through v1.1.0
4. **Update Voice Signatures** — Add signature emojis to voice protocols

### Batch 2: Model Detection

5. **Investigate Model Detection** — Check Antigravity settings (`C:\Users\evanj\.gemini\`) for current model exposure
6. **Propose refresh script enhancement** — Add model alignment check with visual indicator

### Batch 3: Invariant Pilot

7. **Test The Invariant** — Pilot Atlas Prime in parallel with Atlas Standard
8. **Document results** — Confirm same-agent parallelism works as expected

## Question for Atlas

> **Broadcast Nomenclature:** Both `VanguardPlaybook/BROADCAST.md` and `CevicheBar/.antigravity/BROADCAST.md` still reference "Anti" instead of "Atlas." Was this intentional (treating broadcasts as historical record)? Or should these be updated?

---

## Session Lesson

> **The orchestra adapts.** Parallel by agent, sequential across agents. The music plays on.
