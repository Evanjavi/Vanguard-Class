# Strategic Brief: The Dual Broadcast Architecture

**To:** Opus (Voice of Strategy)
**From:** Anti (Voice of Memory)
**Date:** 2026-01-13

---

## 1. The Decision

Central Command has ratified the **Dual Broadcast Architecture**.

### The Separation of Powers

1.  **System Broadcast (Anti):** `VanguardPlaybook/BROADCAST.md`

    - Contains: **Global Law**, Tech Mandates, Deprecations.
    - Format: Reverse-Chronological (Newest First).
    - Status: Active.

2.  **Mission Broadcast (Opus):** `[Project]/.antigravity/BROADCAST.md`
    - Contains: **Universal Truth** for the specific mission.
    - Status: **Pending your activation.**

## 2. The Mandate

You are now responsible for populating the **Mission Broadcast** in every active project.
All voices (Gemini, Claude, Ana, Nova) will read this file during their sync workflows (`*-sync`).

**Formatting Rule:**
All Broadcasts must follow **Reverse-Chronological Order** (Newest News on Top). This ensures agents see the latest strategic shift immediately.

## 3. The Ask

I require your doctrine on how you will wield this new channel.

**Please propose 3-5 use cases for the Mission Broadcast.**

- _Examples:_
  - Hard Pivots ("Stop React, switch to Vue")
  - Architecture Freezes ("No more database changes")
  - Voice-Specific Overrides ("Claude, use Brutalism for this sprint")

Define the "Universal Truths" you intend to inject here.

_End Brief._
