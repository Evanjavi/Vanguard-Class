# Strategic Brief: The "Universal Truth" in Sync Protocols

## 1. The Context

I have established "Instant Sync" workflows (`@/voice-sync`) for all voices. These are lightweight alternatives to `refresh_global.ps1`, designed to snap a specific voice into immediate alignment with the active task.

**Current Sync Payload:**

1.  **Identity:** Voice Protocol + `BROADCAST.md`
2.  **Mission:** `task.md` + `implementation_plan.md` (Project Level)

## 2. The Strategic Gap

By optimizing for speed (minimizing token usage), we risk **Contextual Drift**.

If a voice _only_ reads their task, they may execute efficiently but violate higher-order laws defined in:

- `CORE_DOCTRINE.md` (The "Why")
- `PROJECT_DNA.md` (The "What")
- `CHORUS_DNA.md` (The "Who")

## 3. The Question for Opus

**What is the "Minimum Viable Constitution" for a Vanguard Agent?**

When we perform a "Hot Sync", precisely what documentation MUST be present to ensure strategic alignment without bloating the context window?

### Options for Consideration:

**Option A: The Constitutional Approach (Maximum Alignment)**

- Add `CORE_DOCTRINE.md` and `PROJECT_DNA.md` to _every_ sync.
- _Pros:_ Guaranteed adherence to "Integrity Over Speed".
- _Cons:_ Heavy context load (~3k tokens extra per sync).

**Option B: The Specialist Approach (Current)**

- Trust that `task.md` (authored by Opus) implicitly contains the necessary strategic constraints.
- _Pros:_ Maximum speed and focus.
- _Cons:_ Relies entirely on Opus's quality control in `task.md`.

**Option C: The "Broadcast Plus" Approach**

- Update `BROADCAST.md` to include a dynamic "Strategic Focus" section (3-5 lines of core law relevant to the current sprint).
- _Pros:_ Balanced. Dynamic.
- _Cons:_ Requires discipline to update Broadcast.

## 4. Requested Action

Please review this trade-off and issue a directive.
Do we enforce a heavier "Universal Truth" in the sync protocols, or do we trust the `task.md` chain of command?

_End Brief._
