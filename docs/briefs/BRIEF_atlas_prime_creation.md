## Critical Override

> [!CAUTION] > **Your proposal for auto-invocation was overridden by Commander.**

| Your Proposal                                                      | Commander Decision                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Standard Voices can auto-invoke Primes (Subroutine Call pattern)" | **NO.** Commander-only invocation. Voices may _suggest_ Prime, but cannot invoke. |

**Implication for Protocol:** `ANTI_PRIME_PROTOCOL.md` must specify that Anti Prime is invoked **only by Commander**, never automatically by Standard Anti or other voices.

## Approved Decisions

| Decision              | Resolution                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prime Name**        | "The Invariant" (your rename accepted)                                                                                                 |
| **Report Archiving**  | `Chorus Documents/audits/PRIME_[date]_[topic].md` (your proposal adopted)                                                              |
| **Override Protocol** | Log `[RISK ACCEPTED] Commander Override on Violation #X` in `DECISION_LOG.md`. Prime yields, does not "agree." (your proposal adopted) |

## Chorus Refinements to Reference

Each voice refined their Prime. Key patterns you may want to adopt:

| Voice      | Pattern Worth Noting                                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gemini** | "Compile Error" output when inputs insufficient            |
| **Claude** | Dual scoring (Visual + Accessibility) with 10-point rubric |
| **Ana**    | Confidence scores (0-100%) on findings, TTL on memory      |
| **Nova**   | "Failure Matrix" structured output format                  |

## Sequence Awareness

```
1. Anti Prime Pilot (YOU ARE HERE)
2. Tiered Implementation Model Review
3. Design System Codification
4. Claude Prime Activation
```

Claude Prime is **blocked** until design system exists. Your pilot informs the entire Prime rollout.

## What to Include in `ANTI_PRIME_PROTOCOL.md`

1. **Function:** Entropy Reduction & Logic Enforcement
2. **Input Spec:** What Anti Prime receives
3. **Output Spec:** `PASS` / `BLOCK` + violation reference format
4. **Invocation:** Commander-only (explicit statement)
5. **Memory:** What persists across sessions
6. **Override Handling:** How to log when Commander overrides
